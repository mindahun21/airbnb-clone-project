# 🛏️airbnb-clone-project
-A robust and scalable backend for an Airbnb-like platform, built with Django and Django REST Framework. This system supports user management, property listings, bookings, payments, and reviews, offering both REST and GraphQL APIs for seamless integration.

## ✨ Project Overview
This project replicates core features of Airbnb, enabling users to list, book, and review properties. The backend is designed to ensure secure authentication, efficient data handling, and scalable deployment through modern tools and best practices.

## 🎯 Project Goals
User Management: Registration, login, profile management.

Property Management: CRUD operations for property listings.

Booking System: Allow users to book and manage reservations.

Payment Processing: Handle secure and trackable payments.

Review System: Enable users to leave property reviews and ratings.

Performance Optimization: Use indexing and caching for efficient data access.

## 👥 Team Roles

To ensure smooth execution and high-quality delivery, the Airbnb Clone backend project is structured around clearly defined roles. Each role contributes to specific aspects of the system's architecture, development, and maintenance.

### 🧠 Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the core logic of the application, including API endpoints, database models, and business rules. They ensure secure authentication, data validation, and integration of third-party services (e.g., payment gateways).

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Develop REST and GraphQL APIs using Django and DRF.
- Implement authentication, authorization, and user flows.
- Write unit and integration tests.
- Collaborate with frontend developers for API integration.
